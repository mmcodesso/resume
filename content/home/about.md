My dissertation focused on the development of a framework for Continuous Audit using XBRL and Audit Data Standards. Previously, I worked for 11 years as a software consultant for a major ERP in Brazil, during this time I had the opportunity to work on several projects implementing, customizing and developing business intelligence, data warehouses, and management systems.
